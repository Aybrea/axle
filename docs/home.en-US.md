### Intro

`Axle` is an extension request package based on [`axios`](https://axios-http.com/). Using this tool we assume that you already know `axios`,
`Axle` has all the capabilities of `axios`, and has been extended on the basis of `axios`, allowing developers to focus more on the business itself, simplifying the complexity of request calls, thereby improving production efficiency.
